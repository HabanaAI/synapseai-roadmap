# Habana SynapseAI  

The SynapseAI software suite is designed to facilitate high-performance DL training and inference on Habana’s Gaudi and Goya deep learning accelerators. 

The SynapseAI training SDK enables efficient execution of neural network topologies onto Gaudi hardware. The software suite includes Habana’s graph compiler and runtime, TPC kernel library, firmware and drivers, and developer tools such as the TPC SDK for custom kernel development and SynapseAI Profiler. SynapseAI is integrated with two popular DL frameworks, namely TensorFlow and PyTorch, and performance-optimized for Gaudi.

This repository contains the public roadmap for SynapseAI SDK.
